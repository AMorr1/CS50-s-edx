# CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

**Course followed on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).**

This repository contains my solutions to each problem sets.

I made this repository to post my solutions to Harvard University's <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science'>2020 CS50 intro course</a> assignments and document my progress during the course. <br>
You can find the materials for the course <a href='https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/'>here</a> or look at the assignments specifications linked at right of every section in the table of contents. <br>
Hope this is helpful to other students, if you don't mind please leave a star!
Every exercise in this repository scored 100% on submission.
